Pibeanie Stereo15
=================
a [Raspberry Pi] stereo amplifier [HAT] with 2 x 7.5 Watt HiFi output power.

The Problem
-----------
There are stereo amplifier hats on the market like the [Hifiberry Amp+] which work fine and are affordable. I own a Hifiberry Amp+ but this hat has some limitations which result in this little PCB project.

### Existing Limitations ###
- no possibility to mount the [Raspberry Pi 7" display] in an easy way together with the amplifier hat because the PCB has no cutout for the display flex-cable
- no pin header to supply the [Raspberry Pi 7" display] from the hat directly
- on-board 5 Volt DC/DC converter is limited to ~1.0 Ampere
- no infrared receiver

and last and least: as a professional PCB designer I was a little bit shocked by the PCB design of the [Hifiberry Amp+]. There are very small traces where high currents flow and the component placement of the audio output stage (HF filters) and step-down converter is ridiculous. I expect a lot of unwanted high frequency noise with that PCB design.

The Idea
--------
- a PCB which is kernel-driver-compatible to [Hifiberry Amp+]. That's easy because the audio IC is TI's [TAS5713] which is supported by the Linux kernel and there is only one possibility to connect this chip to the [Raspberry Pi].
- 5V / 3A step-down converter and the possibility to supply the [Raspberry Pi 7" display]
- infrared receiver connectable e.g. [Vishay TSOP32xxx Series]
- EEPROM for device tree BLOBs
- reverse polarity protection
- inrush current limiter

The Realized Board
------------------
My Pibeanie Stereo15

![Pibeanie Stereo15][pibeanie-stereo15.jpg]

a cheap, proof of concept, 2-layer PCB which does work really proper

- [AO4803A] P-FET, with <46mOhm RDSon does the reverse polarity protection and in-rush current limiting.
- [TI TPS62133] 5V/3A step-down converter powers the Raspberry Pi and easily an additional Raspberry Pi 7" display ... and USB hard drives.
- [TAS5713] class D amplifier with a superb output filter design and superior 15000 hour @ 105째C low ESR (23mOhm!) [Nippon Chemi Con PXG Series] polymer aluminum decoupling capacitors. They should last forever!
- solder-pads for optional IR receiver. Vishay TSOP32xxx series.
- solder-pads for device tree blob EEPROM (which is not tested nowadays)
- modular connector (I like them) and 5.5/2.1mm jack. Cheap screw terminals would work as well.

### Filter Design & EMI ###
My expectations: My PCB design generates less high frequency distortion on the audio output lines than my old [Hifiberry Amp+]. Measurements with a digital scope on left and right audio lines show the following signals when driven without any audio signal.

![left channel][pibeanie-stereo15_left.png] ![right channel][pibeanie-stereo15_right.png]

The base frequency of 375kHz can't be filtered out completely but it is far too high to be heard.
The red line is the calculated differential signal between + and - (or vice versa) of a single audio channel. Instead of a speaker a resistive load of 8.91 Ohm was connected.

In comparison: The signal of my Hifiberry Amp+ shows high frequency switching noise with the same measurement setup ... and + and - connections are reversed which doesn't really matter.

### Downsides ###
This design is limited by the maximum input voltage of 17V which is defined by the [TI TPS62133] DC/DC converter. So the maximum audio output power is limited to around 2x10 Watt @ 8 Ohm. Personally, I supply this audio amplifier with a 12V/3A power supply and get only 7.5 Watt @ 8 ohm per channel or around 11W @ 4ohm. I can live with that audio power.

I also made some temperature measurments at 4 and 8 Ohm load and maximum sine amplitude. The maximum temperature measured after ~5 minutes at 4 ohm was 107째C. That's a little bit hot. The [TAS5713] has an over-temperature shutdown which would come to life at 150째C. I didn't want to test it with my unique board. Well, at 8 Ohm the temperature was only around 80째C.

Nowadays I would take a different DC/DC converter. [TI TPS54302] wouldn't limit the supply voltage anymore but needs a much bigger, more expensive, choke.

Component prices could make this Raspberry Pi hat a little bit questionable. I got most parts as free engineering samples. Building this hat in low quantities does you make a poor man. The most expensive parts are the coils from Coilcraft. 4 x XAL1010-153ME does cost around 25$ at Mouser and, honestly, they are heavily oversized. Take a look at the BOM for a complete overview.

I've created a 2 layers PCB instead of 4 layers because 2 layers PCBs are much cheaper especially when ordered in China. I've ordered a bunch of PCBs and a stencil at [ShenZhen2U]. The parts were placed by hand and a cheap reflow oven has done the rest.
Well, with a 2-layer PCB heat dissipation becomes an issue when running at the power limit but my design showed a lower maximum temperature than the 4-Layer Hifiberry Amp+ PCB under similar conditions. In my opinion, no wonder. My copper surfaces are exposed to the air, on the Hifiberry Amp+ PCB you have to search the copper areas.
